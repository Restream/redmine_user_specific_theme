This plugin allows Redmine users to select themes in their account settings. The selected theme will be displayed for the user regardless of the system-wide theme settings.

## Compatibility

This plugin version is compatible only with Redmine 4.x and later.

## Installation

1. To install the plugin
    * Download the .ZIP archive, extract files and copy the plugin directory into *#{REDMINE_ROOT}/plugins*.
    
    Or

    * Change you current directory to your Redmine root directory:  

            cd {REDMINE_ROOT}
 
      Copy the plugin from GitHub using the following command:

            git clone https://github.com/Restream/redmine_user_specific_theme.git plugins/redmine_user_specific_theme

2. Install the required gems using the command:  

        bundle install  

    * In case of bundle install errors, remove the Gemfile.lock file, update the local package index and install the required dependencies. Then execute the `bundle install` command again:  

            rm Gemfile.lock
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get install -y libxml2-dev libxslt-dev libpq-dev
            bundle install

3. Restart Redmine.

Now you should be able to see the plugin in **Administration > Plugins**.

## Usage

The plugin adds the **Theme** setting to the user account. If the **Theme** setting is blank, then the system-wide theme is applied; otherwise, the selected theme is displayed.
